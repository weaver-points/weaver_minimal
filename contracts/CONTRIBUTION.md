# Welcome to Weavers Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Weaver! This guide provides an overview of our contribution workflow, ensuring an effective process for all contributors.

## About the Project

Weaver is a streamlined on-chain identity platform built on the Starknet ecosystem, The platform is designed to index transactions and verify user authenticity across various Starknet protocols, acting as a passport system for the ecosystem. It tracks users' on-chain activities, such as staking events, using Argent as the wallet connector, and rewards them with points for their participation. Users who mint their StarknetID through Argent also receive points based on their engagement.

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr). Here's how to submit a PR:

1. Fork the repo

2. Clone the project

3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name

4. Commit your changes following the commit conventions in [style-guide.md](style-guide.md).

5. Push changes to your fork

6. Open a PR in our repository and tag a maintainer for review.

Here are some tips for a successful PR:

- Ensure the title accurately reflects the changes made.

- Organize the description clearly. Use bullet points and screenshots where appropriate.

#### Once you submit a PR:

Once your PR is approved, we will "squash-and-merge" to maintain a clean commit history.
